Objective:A telecom company is interested in developing an advanced predictive model to predict service disruptions based on the log files generated by multiple devices.
We have to output a csv file that can be handed to the operations team.
So they can priorities dispatch of technicians based on fault_severity prediction and its probability.

Data understanding: The data set is in a relational format, split among multiple files. 
The following provides a description of data in each file.
